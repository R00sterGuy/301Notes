### Windows 10 and Windows server, What's the diff?

They look very similar for instance if you were starting both up at the same time you would notice that the same desktop, same start button, and even the same Kernel and both can run similar softwares but that is where the similarities stop.

Windows 10 was main so where you could sit in front of it and use it like a computer whereas the Windows server was created to be like a server hence the name. As a server it runs services that people can access from across the network. Windows Server can work as a desktop however Microsoft does recommend installing Windows servers without the use of a GUI in order to reduce overhead needed to run a server. We can use the Nano Server (no GUI or local login capabilities) for less space.

Having the GUI enabled does make it to where you can have a server manager program that launches shortly after the Windows Server loads, this service manager makes it to where you can add on server specific features i e DHCP Services Windows deployment services and even active directory domain services. With these features one can deploy an OS remotely to other machines. You can also create static IP addresses for client machines, control a network domain for joining other computers to a domain and create domain users. These features are not available for Windows 10 unless you install third-party software like Apache web server. 
Windows Server also supports SMB Direct for faster file sharing and more support for resilient file systems; only Windows 10 Pro for workstations offers the same. Servers are designed to work in conjunction as well, so you may have one server for feeling one or two of the rules above, and another server taking on other roles to spread the work.

You want to talk about the limitations?
Windows 10 has way more in the form of limitations for instance you can only have 2 terabytes of ram 1 CPU while a Windows Server can have up to 24 terabytes of RAM and the Windows server has no limits for the amount of course it can have

Windows servers lose a lot of the fluff for instance you don't get Cortana the Microsoft store Edge or timeline and instead of and you're going to be using Internet Explorer which is locked down to hinder normal web browsing. If you want to download Google Chrome you're going to end up adding exceptions for all of the Google urls. the extra security within Windows servers makes its present known at nearly any website visited through Internet Explorer.


When using Windows Server you can't sign into your Microsoft account is will keep you from being able to bring any settings from another PC instead you'll even need to sign in with a local account or a domain account and with the Windows Server you can disable updates entirely while you can only just now with Windows 10 home pause updates.

Where's Windows 10 doesn't have the server specific features that comes with Windows servers it is the familiar desktop experience it runs its updates faster and more often it isn't locked down so installing new software especially from the internet requires a lot less effort and your preferences will come with you from one machine to another if you're using Microsoft accounts additionally with Windows 10 you can use other features such as your phone or apps and even some windows subsystems with Linux

The final and biggest difference in my opinion, is the expense with Windows 10 if you had Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 Keys then you would be able to install Windows 10 for free, whereas the Windows server license is going to cost you anywhere between $500 & $6,200 depending on the type you get. This is because Windows servers are meant for businesses & not an individual.
